        Do note that this will only be called if we have pure SymPy

        the rest of the ccode stuff (which basically just calls
        this class anyway).

        The formatting is based specifically on `grad(dir, expr)` because
        the `expr` variable may not always be just a variable name. Regex
        in the `codegen.py` file will correct these to our proper derivative
        type.

        ------
        NotImplementedError
            If the derivative is 3rd order or has incorrect dimensionality
            the printer will not yet work. We can add additional derivative
            support, but Dendro itself does not yet have any code to compute
